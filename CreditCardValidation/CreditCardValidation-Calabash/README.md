=============================

This is a sample project that shows how to use the Page-Object model to create cross-platform mobile tests.

Create a test run at [Xamarin Test Cloud](http://testcloud.xamarin.com) and make note of your API key and device id. Then create a copy of the file `testcloud-submit-example.sh`, (i.e. `testcloud-submit.sh`). Update your copy of the file with your Test Cloud API key. 

Once you have done that, you may run `./testcloud-submit.sh` and it will compile the iOS application and submit it to Test Cloud for you.
